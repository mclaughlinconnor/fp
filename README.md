<h1 align="center">✒️ FP ✒️</h1>
<h3 align="center">Fountain Pen and Ink Inventory</h3>

## Motivation

I have too many pens and too many inks, and the problem is that I am afflicted with not only being human, but also being colour blind.

These two things together mean that I can never remember what ink is in which pen, nor can I figure it out by looking.

## Features

The current feature set is pretty limited seeing as this project was created to satisfy my own need

- List all:
  - Pens
  - Inks
  - Nibs
- Track the associations between all of your different pens, inks, and nibs
- Sync between all of your mobile devices in real time
- Add images and other metadata to pens, inks, and nibs
- Seemless over the air updates
- Searching by all properties, including whether a pen is currently inked or not

## Disclaimer

I built this for my own needs and it seems to work pretty well for that; however, I have tried to make sure it will work well for other users too.
With this in mind, though, bugs are _likely_.

Please open an issue if you find any bugs (or for feature requests) and I'll try to fit it in around work and university

## Releases

The most recent APK will be in the releases.
If there is not a release corresponding to the most recent master release, **this is fine** -- FP uses wireless OTA updates so updates will be downloaded on your device after the APK is installed.
