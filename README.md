# FP

I have too many pens and too many inks, and the problem is that I am afflicted with not only being human, but also being colour blind.

These two things together mean that I can never remember what ink is in which pen, nor can I figure it out by looking.

FP inventories all pens, inks and nibs along with their associations to each other.
